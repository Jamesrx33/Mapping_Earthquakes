## Overview
Using data obtained from JSON sotred in various sources online, we have prepared a map showing earthquake activity and tectonic plate locations around the world. The engine behind our map is Leaflet coupled with the D3 library for HTML/JS integration.
Lines on the map indicate the location of tectonic plates, circles indicate a recorded Earthquake. The size and color of the Circles correlate to the magnitude of the Earthquake in that location. A Popup with location and magnitude information is available for each Earthquake marker.
